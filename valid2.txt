 ¹the ¹decline of the ¹birth-rate in ¹sweden  ¹a negative trend that can be observed in the ¹swedish society of today is the decline of the birth-rate. 
¹in  the number of children born in ¹sweden was  , in  it was   and in  it was as low as  . 
¹the number of deceased persons was  ,   and   respectively - in other words, there is an excess of deaths over births. 
¹at the same time the total population of ¹sweden increased from , million people in  to , million in  and to , million in . 
¹these statistics, which ¹i have obtained from the homepage of the ¹s¹c¹b, illuminate this trend very clearly. 
¹but what are the reasons for this phenomenon?  
¹the main cause of the low birth-rate is the economic situation. 
¹it is simply too expensive for many people to bring up children in our society. 
¹therefore family planning has become usual. 
¹the possibility to avoid unwanted pregnancies through preventives or the alternative to go through a legal abortion has of course had a very great impact on the birth-rates. 
¹the child allowance far from cover the loss of income during pregnancy, maternity leave and all other expenses involved when raising a child. 
¹many couples decide to become parents later in life after having obtained a good job and earned some money and paid off their debts. 
¹sometimes the decision is made too late and others never reach the point in life when they decide that the time to bring children into the world has come.  
¹furthermore, women's position in society has gone through a radical change. 
¹formerly a woman was expected to give birth to children and take care of the household. 
¹these were her major tasks in life. 
¹nowadays women have the opportunity of achieving the same positions in business and professional life as men. 
¹consequently, this has influenced the female way of life. 
¹after compulsory school an increasing number of young men and women continue their studies, at university for example. 
¹the studies often take many years to complete and giving birth to a child during that time is not what most women desire. 
¹after the studies quite a few women want to make a carrier and when they intend to climb the ladder of success children are not considered convenient. 
¹thus women neither have the time nor want to raise children. 
¹it has now become more socially accepted than earlier to have a carrier instead of choosing ordinary family-life if you cannot combine them.   
¹what may the effects of this decline of the birth-rate be? 
¹the most terrifying aspect is that it makes the economy of the country weak. 
¹this may need some further explanation. 
¹the number of people above the age of  was in   of the total population in the ¹o¹e¹c¹d-countries (¹organization for ¹economic ¹co-operation and ¹development) and statisticians have reached the conclusion that the number will be  in . 
¹in other words, the number of retired people will increase and thus the state-budgets will have to be used to take care of old people instead of the younger generation. 
¹this will lead to reduced contributions as regards education and the consequence will be a deteriorated school-system. 
¹the result will be a generation of people without sufficient education. 
¹swedish know-how will decrease and thus weaken the ¹swedish economy. 
¹also other contributions, for instance means for the infrastructure and the military, will diminish and the country will slowly begin to decay.   
¹nevertheless, the troublesome problem with unemployment will fade away when the workers of today retire and their professional posts must be filled. 
¹provided that the school-system still is satisfactory the young people will have no difficulty in finding jobs. 
¹this will, hopefully, lead to a rapid development in society and ¹sweden will catch up with what was lost during the time of "depression". 
¹in the long run this decreasing rate of nativity might be very healthy for the economy of the country, but the change should take place at a slower pace than it does at the moment. 
¹attempts have been made from the government to encourage people to have more children.  
¹in conclusion this trend of decline of the birth-rate is due to the difficult economic situation of the last years. 
¹lately signs indicate that the economic situation is improving and if this is the case, the birth-rate most certainly will improve. 
¹the fact that women make carriers probably does not influence the birth-rate as much as the economic situation does.
