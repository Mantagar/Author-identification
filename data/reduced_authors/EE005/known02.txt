  ¹i¹n¹t¹r¹o¹d¹u¹c¹t¹i¹o¹n ¹w¹i¹t¹h ¹a¹i¹m ¹the aim with my essay is to look at ¹australian vocabulary and idioms, and try to establish their background to see whether they are of ¹british origin, ¹american origin or from the ¹aboriginal languages. 
¹i am also going to exemplify and explain the meaning of the idioms and words when necessary.  
  ¹m¹a¹t¹e¹r¹i¹a¹l ¹a¹n¹d ¹m¹e¹t¹h¹o¹d    ¹i have mainly relied on the kits which were provided and ¹i have been to the library and collected data from various dictionaries and books on idioms. 
¹the limitations with the materials on ¹australian ¹english is that it refers mainly to the usage of slang and colloquialisms. 
¹many of the examples that ¹i have used are therefore slang or colloquial expressions. 
¹i will begin by giving a brief historical background of when the ¹european settlers first came to ¹australia. 
¹my next step is looking at the development of the ¹australian ¹english from the eighteenth century, to nineteenth century and up to the twentieth century. 
¹i will then present ¹australian idioms which ¹i will exemplify and ¹i will end my essay with the conclusion ¹i have come to from the investigation that ¹i have conducted. 
¹the abbreviations that ¹i am using in my essay are ¹am.
¹e. for ¹american ¹english; ¹austral. for ¹australian; colloq. for colloquial; derog. for derogatory; joc. for jocular (humorous or joking); sl. for slang; ¹n.¹z. for ¹new ¹zealand.   
  ¹p¹r¹e¹s¹e¹n¹t¹a¹t¹i¹o¹n  .  ¹historical background  ¹the first settlers arrived in ¹australia in the eighteenth century. 
¹a lot of the settlers were convicts shipped over from ¹britain, but there were others who came there of there own free will. 
¹australia was essentially a ¹british colonial society at that time (¹courtney :). 
¹near the end of the century, however, came the publication of the first dictionary of ¹austral ¹english by ¹e.¹e. 
¹morris. 
¹this was the first important work to show a literate interest of ¹australian ¹english. 
¹the environment that the settlers were faced with were often challenging and the social conditions were new in comparison to what they were used to in ¹britain.  
.  ¹australian words in the eighteenth and nineteenth century  ¹the ¹australians became very resourceful and inventive in their development and use of ¹english. 
¹the new settlers were mainly working class townspeople who moved into a rural life. 
¹they came to describe their way of life by generalising and extending the meaning of words which were more restricted in ¹british ¹english (¹courtney :) ¹new words were derived by composing and other words were borrowed mainly from the ¹aboriginal languages. 
¹other words were invented by the settlers and they are characterised by slang and colloquialism. 
¹examples of words that came about this time (and which are still in use today) are: bush for woods (with compounds like bushman, bushhut, etc); tucker for food; fair dinkum for genuine; paddock for stream or brook; a boomer for anything large, pommy for ¹english(man) and so on (¹courtney :). 
¹the ¹aboriginal words that came into usage in the mid-nineteenth century were mainly place names, for example, ¹wee-¹waa, ¹buntijo, ¹bongongolong, ¹wheeo etc. 
(¹crystal : ). 
¹other ¹aboriginal words are, dingo (a wild dog), waratah (the name of a particular flower), koala, kangaroo and other animal and plant names (¹courtney :).   
. ¹australian words in the twentieth century  ¹the ¹australian society became more suburban and industrialised in this century and most of the population had nothing to do with rural life. 
¹the words that came about were closer to everyday life, for example, words like thongs (¹am.
¹e, a type of shoe), the basic wage, sleep-out came into usage. 
¹other words that have been created are: ¹abo  ¹aboriginal (¹austral sl. often derog.)  arvo  afternoon (¹austral sl.)  
¹buckley's  little or no chance (¹austral. and ¹n.¹z. colloq.)  snag  sausage (¹austral. sl.)  tinnie  can of beer (¹austral. sl.)  wog  micro-organism causing infectious illness (¹austral. sl.) 
¹woop - ¹woop  imaginary remote town or district (¹austral. joc.) 
(¹the ¹australian ¹concise ¹oxford ¹dictionary).  
¹other slang words that are commonly used today are: banana bender for a person from the state of ¹queensland, bludger for parasite, dero for beggar, ning-nong for unintellectual, sango for sandwich and sheila for woman (¹green ). 
¹the vast majority of words in ¹australian ¹english are from ¹british ¹english only a few words come from ¹american ¹english, for example milk bar, median strip, quinella, bubbler. 
¹the ¹british adopted words by far outnumber the ¹american adopted words, much due to that up until the s ¹australians were very much against the adoption of ¹american words (¹ramson :).  
.  ¹the ¹australian idiom  ¹australian ¹english is known for its idioms which display literary creativity and not really everyday frequency (¹crystal:). 
¹here are some examples taken from ¹collins ¹cobuild's  dictionary of idioms from :  done like a dinner  if you are in a competitive situation or a contest and you are done like         dinner, your opponents defeat you completely, often in an unfair way.  drop your bundle  you give up and stop trying to win or succeed if you are failing at something. give someone the flick  to reject or get rid of someone     .   (kanga)roos in your top paddock  someone has peculiar ideas or is crazy.  
¹other idioms are:" bald as a bandicoot, scarce as rocking-horse manure, and look like a consumptive kangaroo." 
¹there are also the domestic idioms, such as, "bring a plate (bring some food to share) and full as a goog (literally 'egg', i.e. 'drunk')" (¹crystal :). 
¹according to ¹j.¹gunn in ¹english ¹transported (edited by ¹ramson :) the idioms in ¹australia are used informally and she warns people not to confuse the occasional short-lived expressions as part of the idiom. 
¹there are a lot of colloquial expressions which do not have to have their meaning explained to ¹australians they are often long-standing slangy expressions like:  doing one's block ( to get angry), going or feeling crook (getting or feeling sick), have a lash (bash) at ( to give it a try), home and hosed (when you have succeeded in your task). 
¹gunn continues (¹ramson :) that there are idioms that are very ¹australian, for example, rough as guts, happy as a pig in shit, mad as a cut snake, lazy as a cut dog, sticking like shit to a blanket, like a rat up a drainpipe and so on. 
¹although some of the expressions may sound vulgar to us they are common expressions in ¹australia and they are not offensive there. 
¹however, ¹gunn says that there are very few expressions that one can call ¹australian.   
  ¹c¹o¹n¹c¹l¹u¹s¹i¹o¹n  ¹the conclusion ¹i have come to in my research is that (although the ¹australian words and idioms are often very colourful and vivid in their descriptions) there are very few words and expressions that can be labelled as being truly ¹australian. 
¹most of the vocabulary and expressions come from ¹british ¹english. 
¹the ¹australians have only extended the meaning of ¹british ¹english words, and they have kept the words and expressions alive even if they are long gone from ¹british ¹english; there are very few ¹australian creations. 
¹i feel that the material which ¹i could find on the topic ¹i chose for my essay was limited and this has affected the outcome of my work.
