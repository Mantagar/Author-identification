 ¹p¹a¹r¹t-¹t¹i¹m¹e ¹f¹a¹t¹h¹e¹r¹s  ¹when a relationship has irretrievably broken down and separation is inevitable, the children are more often than not the real losers. 
¹traditionally the child has always lived with the mother after the break-up of the parents. 
¹there is new trend emerging in ¹sweden, however, part-time fathers are becoming more common, that is, the child lives alternatively with hisher fathermother, for example, every second week. 
¹i have isolated three different causes that ¹i think could have caused this. 
¹firstly, the law reforms that have enabled fathers to play a bigger role in their children's lives. 
¹secondly, the fathers seem to be more willing to take on more responsibility in raising their children. 
¹thirdly, both parents seem to have become aware of the importance of the father's role in the children's lives. 
¹i have based my essay partly on my own views as well as newspaper articles from ¹dagens ¹nyheter and the book ¹sverige ¹en ¹ekonomisk och ¹social ¹historia.  
¹in s and s marriage and especially de-facto relationships became more common than ever before. 
¹during the s law reforms took affect which gave men and women equal opportunity to work and take care of their children. 
¹sweden was unique in that it enabled fathers to go on paternity leave, although, not many of the men took the opportunity to stay at home and look after their children (¹sverige p.). 
¹in ¹october of  another law reform came into affect which gave the courts the right to grant shared custody and alternate living for the child, even if this went against the will of either partner (www.dn.se). 
¹the present day situation have changed, however, and with the  law reform more parents have shared custody than they did before.   
¹the  law reform has given fathers equal opportunity to actively take part in their children's every-day lives and they now have equal say in how to raise their children. 
¹the upbringing of a child was almost an exclusive right that the mothers had before, the father normally only spent time with his child on the week-end. 
¹this created an unrealistic picture in the child's mind of what a father should be like, he became someone that you only did fun things with. 
¹for many fathers being a "week-end-dad" is not enough and with the new reform they can now play an equally important role in their children's lives if they want to.  
¹another development is that both parents are thinking of what is best for their children. 
¹there seem to be an increased awareness that a child need both parents for hisher psychological well-being. 
¹some experts argue, however, that alternate living can be detrimental and that it can cause these children to feel that they do not have a permanent situation in their lives. 
¹a solution to this would be that the child has only one home, and the parents would be the ones having to move back and forth. 
¹according to children living in these situations, constant moving and packing of belongings seemed to be the most negative aspect with having two homes. 
¹they said that they otherwise felt satisfied and it had not affected them emotionally(www.dn.se). 
¹it seems that the children appear quite content with living alternately with their parents, and conclusively it does not seem that this type arrangement would be harmful for the children. 
¹shared custody seems to be a good solution to a difficult situation, it is an advantage if a child maintains a healthy relationship with either parent. 
¹the negative aspect, however, is as ¹i said before that we all need a stable situation. 
¹ideally would (of course) be if the family was one unit, ¹but when this is not possible the model of alternative living seems to be a good solution, and it is apparent that these parents are acting in the best interest of their children.
