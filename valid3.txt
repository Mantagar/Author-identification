 "¹taboo or ¹not ¹taboo"  ¹in the article "¹cleaning up the language" by ¹shirley ¹e ¹peckham, the author takes a clear stand on children who use swear words in their language. 
¹she has a very conservative view of language and wants it to be like "in the good old days" when she was a child. 
¹what she does not realise is that language is changing all the time; if it does not change it is dead. 
¹the part that seems to disturb her the most is that she becomes "filled with disgust" when she hears children use bad language. 
¹furthermore, she is worried that allowing this kind of words will lead to bad language used by everybody in the future. 
¹she has strong opinions on the use of language but nevertheless she does not have any suggestions on how this matter should be solved.    
¹one way for ¹peckham to solve this matter and make her feel better would perhaps be to try to talk with the children involved. 
¹unfortunately, it seems like she is of the opinion that children are as disgusting as swear words so ¹i doubt she will ever confront them. 
¹my experience though, is that it is often a good idea to talk to children about different problems that occur. 
¹if you talk to them on an appropriate level and do not patronize them you have at least a possibility to change a negative pattern. 
¹to use the method that ¹peckham is suggesting as solution, namely to box a child around his or her ears, is what ¹i would call disgusting. 
¹peckham has been raised in this manner and perhaps it is the only way she knows to demand respect and to make someone listen to her. 
¹but to my mind abusing a child by threatening or hitting him or her is not a very constructive or educational way of learning. 
¹i do believe that children learn better if they are secure and not scared of the people around them.   
¹in her article ¹peckham also refers to this language as "foul anti-social". 
¹i would say that she has misinterpreted the situation completely. 
¹on the contrary, the language between children in a group is definitely a very social phenomenon. 
¹by using a certain kind of language it is possible for them to identify themselves with the rest of the group and this is of great importance while growing up. 
¹in addition ¹i am convinced that most children have the judgement not to use bad language when it is not suitable, for example when they talk to older relatives. 
¹in contrast to ¹peckham, ¹i do believe in children's ability to adjust to different situations.    
¹this above-mentioned ability is also the answer to the author's fear of swear words becoming general practice in the future. 
¹perhaps is it also a question of maturity. 
¹this kind of words may be common in children's language but when they grow up these words usually reduce in number or at least they are not used in public so frequently. 
¹even ¹mrs ¹peckham admits that she swore when she was a child, even if she does it reluctantly. 
¹for her it seems to be a question about swear words being taboo or not taboo and maybe the reason to this is the way she was treated as a child when she swore.   
¹to sum up ¹i would like to say that it is not so difficult for me to accept children that swear or the words in themselves. 
¹but to ¹mrs ¹peckham and the likes of her ¹i cannot emphasise enough the importance of verbal communication to solve a matter instead of using violence. 
¹communication will lead to children feeling safe and is not that what we all want?
